# kevo_ex (ðŸš§ Work in progress ðŸš§)
An Elixir client library for Kevo's reverse engineered web API.

Kevo locks were launched in 2016 and discontinued in 2022. While they're unlikely to receive support for [Seam](https://www.seam.co/), the existing web API should (hopefully) remain (relatively) stable.

## Todo
- Evaluate improving websocket API
- Diagnose websocket quietly dropping
- Add function and module docs
- Use structured logging + format callbacks
  - Provide a format callback in the metadata (straightforward enough...)
  - Where do I add the 'middleware' to call said callback? (Maybe `Logger.Translator`)
- Refactor `Kevo.Client.Api` to process messages concurrently

## Installation
`kevo_ex` is a work in progress and isn't yet available on hex.

<!--
If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `kevo_ex` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:kevo_ex, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at <https://hexdocs.pm/kevo_ex>.
-->

## Usage

Add Kevo

```elixir
Logger.configure(level: :debug)
Logger.add_translator({Kevo.StateMachineTranslator, :translate}) 
Kevo.Api.Client.start_link(username: "", password: "")
Kevo.Api.get_locks()
```
