# kevo_ex (ðŸš§ Work in progress ðŸš§)
An Elixir client library for Kevo's reverse engineered web API.

Kevo locks were launched in 2016 and discontinued in 2022. While they're unlikely to receive support for [Seam](https://www.seam.co/), the existing web API should (hopefully) remain (relatively) stable.

- Evaluate if the concurrent API is worth keeping
- Fix the query module paths I just broke
- *See if this can't be done any cleaner*

## Todo Before `0.1.0`
- Improve websocket API
- Diagnose websocket quietly dropping
- Add function and module docs
- Use structured logging with format callback functions
  - Provide a format callback in the metadata (straightforward enough)
  - Where do I add the 'middleware' to call said callback? (Maybe `Logger.Translator`)
  - Translator should only affect this application and none others
- Refactor `Kevo.Api.Client` to process messages concurrently

## Installation
`kevo_ex` is a work in progress and isn't yet available on hex.

<!--
If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `kevo_ex` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:kevo_ex, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at <https://hexdocs.pm/kevo_ex>.
-->

## Usage
Add Kevo to your supervision tree:
```elixir
children = [
  {Kevo, [name: Kevo, username: "username", password: "password", websocket_callback: CallbackModule]}
]
```

```elixir
Logger.configure(level: :debug)
Logger.add_translator({Kevo.StateMachineTranslator, :translate})
Kevo.Api.Client.start_link(username: "", password: "")
Kevo.Api.get_locks()
```
